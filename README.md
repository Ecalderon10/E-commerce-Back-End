1.When approaching this project I started off with the models, giving them Keys and inputs in order to display the correct information
2.Secondly I addressed the associations between all the models and exported them through the index.js
3. After this I built out all the routes for Product, Tags, and Categories.
4.When completeing the routes I tested all of them in insomnia 



## Suedo Code


GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
